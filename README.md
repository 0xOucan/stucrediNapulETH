# üéì StuCredi - Student Credit Based on Academic Performance

<h4 align="center">
  Built for NapulETH Hackathon using Scaffold-ETH 2
</h4>

üéØ StuCredi is a decentralized application that connects sponsors with high-performing students, providing financial support based on academic achievements and event participation. The platform uses a unique point system that considers both academic grades and participation in tech events (proven by NFTs) to determine funding allocation.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

## üöÄ Live Deployment

**‚úÖ Verified Contracts on Avalanche Fuji Testnet:**

- **CustomNFT**: [`0xa4ba4e9270bde8fbbf4328925959287a72ba0a55`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xa4ba4e9270bde8fbbf4328925959287a72ba0a55)
- **Vault**: [`0x3d6cb29a1f97a2cff7a48af96f7ed3a02f6aa38e`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x3d6cb29a1f97a2cff7a48af96f7ed3a02f6aa38e)
- **RateMe**: [`0x79e043686cce3ee4cd66fc2dbe15fda812da5285`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x79e043686cce3ee4cd66fc2dbe15fda812da5285)

All contracts are verified and ready to interact with on [Snowtrace](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/).

## Core Features

- üé® **CustomNFT Contract**: Enables sponsors to create and distribute NFTs for events and activities
- üí∞ **Vault Contract**: Manages USDC deposits from sponsors and handles fund distribution
- ‚≠ê **RateMe Contract**: Calculates student funding based on grades and NFT points
- üîÑ **15-minute Rounds**: Quick funding cycles for testing and demonstration
- üìä **Point System**:
  - 1 RATE Token = 10 micro-USDC = 0.000010 USDC
  - Minimum points: 50 (POINTS_MIN)
  - Maximum points: 150 (POINTS_MAX)
  - Each NFT = 5 points (POINTS_PER_NFT)
  - Academic grades (1-100) contribute directly to points
  - Students use `claim(grade)` to get RATE tokens
  - Students use `redeem(rateAmount, sponsor)` to get USDC

## Smart Contracts Architecture

### CustomNFT.sol
- Simple NFT collection for activity participation
- Each NFT represents 5 points in the system
- Sponsors can mint and distribute NFTs to participating students

### Vault.sol
- Manages USDC deposits from sponsors using `fundStream(total, perRound)`
- RateMe contract pulls USDC via `pullAllowance(sponsor, usdcUnits)`
- 15-minute round system with `MAX_PER_ROUND` limit (1500 micro-USDC)
- Emergency withdrawal function for admin

### RateMe.sol
- Students claim RATE tokens using `claim(grade)` function
- Calculates tokens based on:
  - Student's academic grade (1-100)
  - Number of activity NFTs held (5 points each)
- Students redeem RATE tokens for USDC using `redeem(rateAmount, sponsor)`
- Maximum 150 RATE tokens per round
- 1 RATE = 10 micro-USDC = 0.000010 USDC
