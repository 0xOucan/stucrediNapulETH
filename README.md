# üéì StuCredi - Student Credit Based on Academic Performance

<h4 align="center">
  Built for NapulETH Hackathon using Scaffold-ETH 2
</h4>

üéØ StuCredi is a decentralized application that connects sponsors with high-performing students, providing financial support based on academic achievements and event participation. The platform uses a unique point system that considers both academic grades and participation in tech events (proven by NFTs) to determine funding allocation.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.
